## Active Work: Testing + Merging PRs One by One

**Order (easiest → hardest to verify):**
- [x] #60 standards/sitemap-robots — MERGED ✓ (sitemap at events root; root repo gets robots.txt + sitemap index)
- [x] #56 standards/og-meta-fixes — MERGED ✓ (og:type article on talk+synthesis; Yogaval → site.title)
- [x] #59 standards/hreflang-canonical — MERGED ✓ (canonical + hreflang EN/ES/NE/x-default on all pages)
- [x] #65 standards/json-ld — MERGED ✓ (Article JSON-LD with description, abstract, publisher, isPartOf)
- [x] #62 design/lang-select-mobile — MERGED ✓ (progressive compression: full→compact→abbreviated→select; dead code removed)
- [ ] #66 design/ab-theme-flag — DEFERRED (UX redesign needed; revisit after #61 merged)
- [x] #57 design/devanagari-font — MERGED ✓ (spacing only; Nirmala UI system font retained)
- [x] #58 design/touch-targets — MERGED ✓ (44px audio/PDF targets, X modal button, overlay 0.50)
- [x] #61 design/font-size-tokens — MERGED ✓ (CSS tokens, 18px base, #f7f7f7 background)
- [ ] #67 test/regression-wave-1 — merge last after all others pass ← **NEXT**

**Protocol per PR:**
1. `git checkout <branch> && npm run build`
2. Claude verifies via curl/filesystem + flags any issues
3. User checks `http://localhost:8080/events/2026-uruguay/...`
4. Both confirm → `gh pr merge <n> --squash` → update checklist above on main

## Flags Noted During Testing

- **#60**: `robots.txt` domain root handled by `yogicapproach/yogicapproach.github.io`. Section sitemap correctly at `yogicapproach.com/events/sitemap.xml`. CI issue filed at root repo (#2). Root repo issue #1 closed.

## After All PRs Merged — Next Major Task

**Issue #63: URL Architecture — Move lang to root path**
- Current: `yogicapproach.com/events/2026-uruguay/en/...`
- Target: `yogicapproach.com/en/events/2026-uruguay/...` (lang always segment 1)
- Branch: `arch/lang-at-root` (to be created)
- Prerequisites: all current PRs merged and green on main

## Agent Permission Issue — To Resolve

Agents with `isolation: "worktree"` don't inherit Bash permissions.
Fix: add git/gh to `allowedTools` in `.claude/settings.json` — create GH issue before next agent wave.
